## Application for Improving the Understanding and Management of Transcribed Medical Reports

### Description

Fragmentation in healthcare and the lack of effective communication among specialists are major issues that significantly impact the quality of treatment and patient health. This project presents an AI-powered solution that optimizes the management and retrieval of transcribed medical reports by implementing a clustering algorithm to group documents based on shared characteristics.

The tool enables automated classification of new reports, supports transversal queries across specialties, and provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals to enhance decision-making and interdisciplinary coordination

### Features

-Automated classification of medical transcriptions into 18 different specialties.

-Interactive data analysis and visualization for improved comprehension.

-Graph generation to illustrate the distribution of medical specialties.

-User authentication and authorization system for secure access.
